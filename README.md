Use at your own risk!

This was originally a FYSETC kit voron, so it's using the [Spider 3.0 board](https://github.com/FYSETC/FYSETC-SPIDER).
Also see [Voron 2.4](https://github.com/VoronDesign/Voron-2) if you don't know what a voron is.

Since then, a lot of hardware and software mods have been added by me so here is a klipper config dump with the macros i've created/repurposed/procured. 
Some of the mods:
- [Tapchanger](https://github.com/viesturz/tapchanger)
- [CANbus](https://github.com/bigtreetech/EBB) for all toolheads
- [Bedfans] i'll add the link soon
- WIP on [Blobifier](https://github.com/Dendrowen/Blobifier)
- more...

I'll add pictures soon.
